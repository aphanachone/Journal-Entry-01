## **Observing the Heuristics of Cruise Control on the Highway**

*By Austin Phanachone March 10, 2023*

I've recently had the pleasure of trouble shooting cruise control while driving on the highway. My foot was getting tired of holding the pedal down and made it my goal to activate cruise control despite not using it on my car before. Car manufacturer seem to have different approaches on implementing cruise control. 

The Toyota Corolla in particular uses a switch with a button on the side inconveniently located behind the steering wheel.

Thi is a problem for first time users. Being behind the steering wheel would mean that users would have to blindly reach for it so that their eyes remained on the road. First time users wouldn't be able to see the symbols on the switch. An easy fix would be to make it more visible. Some cars, like the Honda CRV, have it integrated onto the steering wheel. 

The symbol in the in the middle as the industry standard symbol for cruise control, an example of **[Consistency and Standards]** in this device. 
Pressing the button had the same symbol light up green next to the speedometer. However, this does not mean that cruise control was activated. This was not a **[Match between System and the Real World]** as a green indicator light usually indicates the system was activated. Unfortunately, when I removed my foot from the pedal, the car began to lose speed.

With no prior experience with using cruise control I glanced at the switch and saw the cancel followed by the arrow pointing towards me. Upon moving it towards me, the green indicator light disappeared. Upon turning the system back on I pushed the switch upward which would "+RES." This caused the HUD to display an additional speed above my speedometer. I could also feel the car begin to accelerate on its own to match the speed, a clearer indication of a **[Match between System and the Real World]**.

The system seemed to be **error tolerant** as there was an easy way to turn off the system. Additionally, the "+" and "-" were clear and easy to understand. Pushing the switch up and down would change the speed of cruise control. While it was hard to find, the cruise control switch was **learnable** and **memorable** as there were only four gestures that you had could perform.
