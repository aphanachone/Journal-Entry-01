## **Observing the Heuristics of Cruise Control on the Highway**

*By Austin Phanachone March 10, 2023*

I've recently had the pleasure of trouble shooting cruise control while driving on the highway. My foot was getting tired of holding the pedal down and made it my goal to activate cruise control despite not using it on my car before. Car manufacturer seem to have different approaches on implementing cruise control. Some like the Honda CRV have it nice and visible on top of the steering wheel.

The Toyota Corolla in particular uses a switch with a button on the side inconveniently located behind

The symbol in the in the middle is an example of **[Consistency and Standards]** as it represents cruise control in most cars.

Pressing the button will have the symbol light up next to the speedometer. However, this does not mean that cruise control is
activated. This was not a **[Match between System and the Real World]** as a green indicator light usually indicates the system was activated. Unfortunately, when I removed my foot from the pedal, the car began to lose speed.

With no prior experience with using cruise control I glanced at the switch and saw the cancel followed by the arrow pointing towards me. Upon moving it towards me, the green indicator light disappeared.
