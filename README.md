## **Observing the Heuristics of Cruise Control on the Highway**

*By Austin Phanachone March 10, 2023*

I've recently had the pleasure of trouble shooting cruise control while driving on the highway.
Car manufacturer seem to have different approaches on implementing cruise control.
The Toyota Corolla in particular uses a switch with a buttom on the side to access its Cruise Control function.

The symbol in the in the middle is an example of **[Consistency and Standards]** as it represents cruise control in most cars.

Pressing the button will have the symbol light up next to the speedometer. However, this does not mean that cruise control is
activated. This was a dissonance **[Match between System and the Real World]** as a green indicator light usually indicates
something in the system was activated.
